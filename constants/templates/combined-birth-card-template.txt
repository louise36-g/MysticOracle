COMBINED BIRTH CARD TEMPLATE
=============================
These are the meanings for when your SOUL CARD and PERSONALITY CARD are THE SAME.
This creates a unified, amplified energy - no separation between inner self and outer expression.

This applies to cards 1-9 (when birth date reduces to a single digit).
