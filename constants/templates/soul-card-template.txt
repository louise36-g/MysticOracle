SOUL CARD TEMPLATE
===================
These are the meanings for cards 1-9 when they appear as your SOUL CARD in a pair.
The Soul Card is the reduced number - your inner essence, your deepest truth.
This template is for when Soul ≠ Personality (paired with a different Personality Card).

Pairs where these appear as Soul Cards:
- Soul 1 (Magician) ← Personality 10 (Wheel) or Personality 19 (Sun)
- Soul 2 (High Priestess) ← Personality 11 (Justice) or Personality 20 (Judgement)
- Soul 3 (Empress) ← Personality 12 (Hanged Man) or Personality 21 (World)
- Soul 4 (Emperor) ← Personality 13 (Death) or Personality 22/0 (Fool)
- Soul 5 (Hierophant) ← Personality 14 (Temperance)
- Soul 6 (Lovers) ← Personality 15 (Devil)
- Soul 7 (Chariot) ← Personality 16 (Tower)
- Soul 8 (Strength) ← Personality 17 (Star)
- Soul 9 (Hermit) ← Personality 18 (Moon)
