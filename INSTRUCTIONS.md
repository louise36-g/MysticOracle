To ensure your API key is used securely and correctly, please create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.

Inside this `.env` file, add the following line, replacing the placeholder with your actual OpenRouter API key:

VITE_API_KEY=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

I will now update the code to read this environment variable. After this, you will need to **restart your development server** for the changes to take effect.
